									<h2>Why is the Entertainment Sector a cybercrime  target?</h2>
									<p>If you thought the entertainment industry was safe think again like everything else in this world it is not. This sector has had its particular share of criminality whether it be in the present or the past.</p>
									<br><br>
									<h3>Crimes in the past with no&#47;little technology:</h3>
									<ul type="circle">
										<li>Leak &#45; Ever since the begining of the Broadcast and Entertainment industry there has been some for of information leaking whether it be a disgruntle employee trying to get back at the company or somebody that works at the company trying to make a profit by leaking sensible information about any projects. </li>
										<li>Bootleg Movies and CD &#45; This is the aquisition copyrigthed content like movies and music illegaly usually to sell to the public and make a profit.</li>
										<li>Ransome &#45; This is the aquisition of confidential content to hold hostage until the company that owns it pays the money that is being demanded, this was usually done by stealing the hard drive containing the information and probably destroying all the copies so the company couldnt access it until the money is paid.</li>
									</ul><br>
									</p>
									<br>
									<h3>How Technology Improved the Crime:</h3>
									<ul type="circle">
										<li>Data Breahces &#45; According to to Trend Micro a data breach can be defined as &#34; an incident where information is stolen or taken from a system without the knowledge or authorization of the system's owner&#34;. This is the updated version of physical leaking as the person doesnt physically need to work for the company, since the hacker can access the information remotely and leak to the world what ever they get their hands on</li>
										<li>Bootleg Movies and CDs &#45; As technology became more available the need to copy these movies or CDs to a physical CD or DVD lessened, as the access to the internet became more readily available people just video movies in the cinemas and publish them online for others to access and songs can be accessed anywhere online and downloaded for free. This is thought to be illegal because we are enjoying copyrigthed content without paying the designated price. The other way to aquire movies was through the use of torrents</li>
										<li>Ransomeware &#45; This is a cyber attack in which hackers use malware that encrypts valuable data files and then demand a ransome to release them &#40; FBI Wbesite, n.d&#41;. An example of this is theft of Disney&#39;s Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Men Tell no Tails, it is believed the hacker demanded about &#36;80,000 disney refused to pay &#40;Pammenter, 2017&#41;</li>
