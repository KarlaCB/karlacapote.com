									<h2>Why is the Finance Sector a cybercrime  target?</h2>
									<p>As technologies get better, we become more dependent on the way they make life easier. The same applies for financial institutions e.g banks they have increasingly become dependent on their information systems to carry out their daily tasks. Just imagine that all your information is up for grabs as soon as the bank systems become compromised. Financial instituions like banks are usually targets becuase they can be seen as a cyber criminal gold mine as here they can access your money and personal information to sell on the black market.</p>
									<br><br>
									<h3>Crimes in the past with no&#47;little technology:</h3>
									<ul type="circle">
										<li>Fraud &#40;Insurance fraud, tax fraud&#41; &#45; According to dictionary.com fraud can be defined as &#34;the deceit, trickery, sharp practice, or breach of confidence, perpetrated for profit or to gain some unfair or dishonest advantage&#34;. An e.g of insurance fraud is burning down a property you own while making it look like an accdient to collect the insurance money.</li>
										<li>Identity Theft &#45; This can be defined as the deliberate use of someone elses identity to gain some kind of advantage. Before there were such great improvements in technology criminals used to trick people into provinding them with their Social Security Number in order to use their identity by making fake IDs with their pictures using the victims information as their own.</li>
										<li>Bank Heist - Back in day a lot of planning and coordination went into a bank heist, things like weapons had to be aquired, coordinating the best time to strike, finding a getaway driver and figuring out how to hide when everything goes down.</li>
									</ul><br>
									</p>
									<br>
									<h3>How Technology Improved the Crime:</h3>
									<ul type="circle">
										<li>Internet Fraud - This can be considered the high tech version to fraud. According to the FBI website this is the use of internet services to defraud others or to take advantage of them e.g Phishing/Spoofing</li>
									<ul type="square">
										<li>Phishing/Spoofing &#45; This is a technique used by many cyber criminals this involves the sending of a mass email with a bank link, this is in hopes that someone clicks the link, once a person clicks the link and logs into the bank the hacker collects all their bank detail, an authentication error is usually generated and a link is given to log back in but this link takes you to the real bank site where your second attempt at logging in is successful &#40;FBI Website, n.d&#41;.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Card Skimming - This a technique used to obtained the information on the magnetic strips. This usually done by putting an extention over the ATM where you place your card, after this is done the criminal can access your accounts, clone your cards or even sell your card information on the black market &#40;Dennis, n.d&#41;. This can be considered the modernized identity theft because once the thief gets access to your banking information they have access to all the important information to steal your identity. </li>
									<li>Distributed Denial of Servie &#45; This is an interruption in a user's network usually caused with malicious intent. The way a DOS works is that hackers would have a botnet set up and at a specific moment in time the botnet will be activated and it will overload the servers of the intended target with reguest causing the system to become vulnerable. This kind of attacks can be carried out on e-commerce sites which can cripple the internet commerce as seen on March 7, 2000 when a young boy crippled the websites of companies like Amazon and E-Bay &#40; Dennis, n.d &#41;. </li>
