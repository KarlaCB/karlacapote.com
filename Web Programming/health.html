									<h2>Why is the Health Sector a cybercrime  target?</h2>
									<p>Another cyber criminal gold mine is the health sector. This is because in hospital files like bank accounts all of a person&#39;s personal information but unlike banks the data is not as well protected. This leads to your personal information being up for grabs and there is a lot of money to be made in the dark web when it comes to dealing with buying and selling of other persons personal information.</p>

									<h3>Crimes in the past with no&#47;little technology:</h3>
									<p>Was unable to find information...but stay tuned as soon as i do it will be uploaded</p>
									<br>

									<br>
									<h3>How Technology Improved the Crime:</h3>
									
									<ul type="circle">
										<li>Ransomeware &#45; This is a cyber attack in which hackers use malware that encrypts valuable data files and then demand a ransome to release them &#40; FBI Wbesite, n.d&#41;. An a resent e.g of this was in 2016 when hackers hacked Hollywood Presbyterian Medical center and demanded &#36;17,000 to restore all the hospitals applications, the doctors spent over a week without access to medical records and had to keep paper records until the ransome amount was paid&#40; InfoSec Resources, 2016&#41;</li>
										<li>Social Engineering &#45; In this method hackers usually target the companies that have public employee contact information and send a phishing email with an attachment, once this attachment is opened it infects the users computer and can then infect the whole computer network &#40; InfoSec Resources, 2016&#41;.</li>
										<li>MEDJACK &#45; This is a relatively new method being used as cyber criminals gain access by targeting medical devices with integrated applications, this can usually create a backdoor that can go undetected for a long time &#40; InfoSec Resources, 2016&#41;. Recent victim of this technique was UCLA Health, over 4.5 million patients personal data was exposed.</li>
