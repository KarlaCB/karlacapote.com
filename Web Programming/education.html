									<h2>Why is the Education Sector a cybercrime  target?</h2>
									<p>The education sector usually caters for different types of crimes than the other sectors we have looked at, the education sector is usually the target of depraved individuals or people that are looking to harm others. It&#39;s usually a target becuase here is where you can find young people that are easily pursuaded and hurt.</p>
									<br><br>
									<h3>Crimes in the past with no&#47;little technology:</h3>
									<ul type="circle">
										<li>Bullying &#45; According to stopbullying.gov bullying can be defined as the unwanted, aggressive behavior among school children that involves real or perceived power imbalance. Bullying has ost the lives of millions of children world wide as sometimes they can&#39;t hald it and committ suicide. Before technology this usually involed physical contact and verbal harrassment</li>
										<li>Stalking &#45; According to dictionary.com stalking can be defined as the act of harrassing another in an aggressive, often threatening manner. Before technology stalkers followed their victims around all day.</li>
										<li>Child Pornography &#45; This is the possession of imagery of children under 18 in any form that might be considered as sexual beahvior&#40; Dennis, n.d&#41;. Before technology child pornography was usually obtained through stalkers that took pictures of naked girls in their homes or by simply videoing a sexual encounter with a minor</li>
									</ul><br>
									</p>
									<br>
									<h3>How Technology Improved the Crime:</h3>
									<ul type="circle">
										<li>Cyberbullying &#45; This is the use of the internet to display aggressive, unwanted behavior towards others. The main difference between cyberbullying and regualr bullying is that the bullies don&#39;t have to show their face and that harrassment can be publically viewed by anyone with access to the internet.</li>
										<li>Stalking &#45; For this particular one i dont believe that the person would ever have to leave their house. As the use of technology became more wide spread and social media came about us humans developed a need to post everything that goes on in our lives this just makes the stalkers job easier as they know where we are at all times through social media and a stalker can verbal harrass their victim over the internet no need for physical contact.</li>
										<li>Child Pornography &#45; Technology has aided this as there are viruses that can infect your computer and remotely activate the webcam and young girls can be videoed in the privacy of their own homes and the images can be sold to kiddie porn websites&#40;which are illegal&#41;.</li>
